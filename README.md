# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Transfer Decisions

## Overview

Developed a highly accurate machine learning model to predict transfer decisions using Sci-kit learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and ensemble techniques. This project involved extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and patterns, handling missing values, feature engineering, and building robust machine learning pipelines.
